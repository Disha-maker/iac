## Why bother with a review?

The whole purpose of us carrying out PR reviews, is to get a second opinion on the code changes being submitted. A review can be carried out by anyone,however merging rights are litmited. If you ever see a PR and you take interest feel free to add comments and provide a review, this will help everyone in the end and we love additional community interaction.

Although our reviews don't catch everything, this is final defense line for anything our automated tests cannot catch.

## Process to getting your content reviewed

- Submit PR (For more info check out our CONTRIBUTING.md doc that exists in all of our supported module repos)
- We work to try to review all PRs on a Monday on Community day (unless stated otherwise in our [Friday weekly blog](https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/))
- Anything urgent please [contact us](https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/team/2021/01/20/reaching-out.html)

## The role of a Reviewer

### Ask yourself as a reviewer...

- What does this PR do?
- Does this PR do what it is supposed to?
- Is this PR title reflective of the changes made? (PR titles make up our CHANGELOG)
- Is the code readable?
- Can it be shorter?
- Can it be smarter?
- Does it have adequate test coverage?
- Is the functionality documented in the readme or [code](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/puppet_strings.html) when applicable?

 <span style="color: red;">DO NOT: Just merge</span> _if you are unsure ask someone else for additional input_

**Our main rule is that the Submitter and Reviewer have to be 2 different people.**

## Who can merge my PR?

This will depend on a per repo basis, however usually it will be members of the team that own the repo
we are currently working with the community to get some people onboard as 'Trusted Contributors' that will have merge rights.
