Hey everyone,

A reply was sent to the IT Support in the ticket raised last week after chatting to my mentor Paula in my weekly 1:1 session of what to do with the 'unapproved process page' archived in the Puppet Forge Space on Confluence.

I had many follow-up meetings with my manager this week on the Confluence Wiki Revamp Project. I tried to learn how to break down the bigger task into smaller sub tasks in JIRA so that the are easy to manage. Currently, I am struggling to write good, simple and easy to understand JIRA tickets with relevant sub tasks due to which my work is not progressing too well. I am thinking of how to overcome this new hurdle!

One ticket was resolved this week only
- [IAC-1643](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1643)

Still waiting for review on the following 3 tickets
- [IAC-1656](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1656)
- [IAC-1678](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1678)
- [IAC-1684](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1684)

Stay tuned more information!

That's everything for this week!

See you next week!
