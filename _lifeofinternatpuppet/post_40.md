Hi everyone!

This week has been quite short for me as I wrap up some tickets on the IAC Confluence Wiki Project before going on PTO from Wednesday 23rd June - Friday 25th June.

Really looking forward to the getting some time off!

The following tickets were closed and many pages were made live on Confluence :)
- [Ticket 1](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1583)
- [Ticket 2](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1590) - A [new ticket](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1656) was raised and is currently under review to add actions items for some of the missing pages.
- [Ticket 3](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1621)
- [Ticket 4](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1626)
- [Ticket 5](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1584)
    - [Ticket 5_i](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1631)
    - [Ticket 5_ii](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1632)
    - [Ticket 5_iii](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1633)
    <br/><br/>
- [Ticket 6](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1650)
- [Ticket 7](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1652)
    - [Ticket 7_i](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1653)
    - [Ticket 7_ii](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1654)
    - [Ticket 7_iii](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1655)
<br/><br/>

I also created some backlog tickets which I will pick up once back from PTO.

See you next week!
