Hi all,

I hope you all are enjoying the sunny weather of Belfast :)

I had a busy week as always!

Some of the key highlights from this week...

- I learnt how to work effectively on community day Mondays during 1:1 session with my manager Norman. Some of the things discovered were how to fill out community day spreadsheet when reviewing release prep PRs generated by the automated bot in Github over weekends.

- I continued to work on my IAC Confluence Wiki Project, I paired up with my mentor Paula and manager Norman on Tuesday afternoon. In the meeting, we went over the Google Doc created for this project and how it can be improved etc. This meeting will be repeated every 2 weeks with manager and mentor Paula every fortnight.

- I really enjoyed the show and tell session this week! Thanks to Ben Ford and Gabriel Nagy for the discussions/demos.

- I also attended a drop in session from Queen's University Belfast, hosted by the careers team regarding the upcoming placement assessment due in early June. Thanks for giving such a useful session!

That's all for this week!

Have a lovely weekend, enjoy the sunshine everyone :)
