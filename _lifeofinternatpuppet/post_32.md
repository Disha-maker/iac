Hello everyone,

What a busy week?

- The module release this week was for [puppetlabs-chocolatey](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/chocolatey) (v6.0.1)

- IAC New Start Guide - 'Accessing IAC Training Materials' on Confluence has been finished. I made some changes based on the feedback received from manager for example have a separate page for Show and Tell Sessions within the IAC Wiki.

- I was told to start working on gathering ideas, create epics and JIRA tickets, write some examples of user stories, design few prototypes for some pages with appropriate pros and cons on my new and bigger project called 'Revamp the IAC Confluence Wiki for the team'

I am really enjoying working on this project so far :)

That's everything for this week!

Have a lovely weekend everyone!

Enjoy the sun :)
