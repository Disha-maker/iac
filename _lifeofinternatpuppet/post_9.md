Hi all,

I worked on this [ticket](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1220) when running acceptance tests against puppet 5, 6 and 6 nightly agent builds on the [puppetlabs-helm](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-helm) module.

I also attended the Halloween Trivia Event, really enjoyed it.

That's all for this week.

Enjoy your weekend everyone!
