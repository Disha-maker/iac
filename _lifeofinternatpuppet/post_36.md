Hi everyone,

Key highlights from this week included...

- I applied for PTO for all next week. Looking forward to getting time off!

- I continued to work on my IAC Confluence Wiki Project, shared the IAC Homepage new proposed design to gather feedback from the IAC Team. Thanks to David Schmitt and Sheena for the feedback!

- Thank you to the community member (Ragnarkon) for suggesting my name for the Puppetize Digital 2021 talk. Thank you to David Schmitt for forwarding this message! I am really looking forward to this opportunity, stay tuned for more information!

That's all for this week!

Have a good weekend everyone!
See you again once I am back from the PTO!
