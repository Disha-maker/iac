Hello everyone, Not a lot of time left for Easter break now :)

- I received feedback from manager during our 1:1 session on the Confluence page - 'Accessing IAC Training Materials'
   - Have a description for hyperlinks
   - Possibly have a list for show and tell sessions
   - Underscores for dates
   - Have embeded videos running inside a window

- I took all this feedback into consideration and decided to revamp the page completely with sections and expanded macros. I was also given a tip of tagging the presenter name, adding the duration and content of the video.
Thanks Norman for the useful tips!
I am currently working on this document, stay tuned for more information!

- On the triage day Monday, I released two new modules:-
   - [puppetlabs-apt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/pull/980) (v8.0.2)
   - [puppetlabs-ntp](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ntp/pull/616) (v9.0.1)

The key learnings from doing these releases were:-
   - How to publish the module using the Actions Tab on Github (tagging will be done automatically on Github and its on the forge). Previously, the new version was uploaded manually onto the forge using the new release process.

- I also reviewed and merged PRs for Danny on the triage day
   - [puppetlabs-service](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-service/pull/178)
   - [puppetlabs-rook](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-rook/pull/113)
   - [puppetlabs-puppet_conf](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-puppet_conf/pull/142)
   - [puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager/pull/180)

- When raising PRs for the pending blog posts, I noticed that duplicated commits were getting pushed. I learnt another new thing, which was that always fetch and rebase from the main branch, what I was doing before was fetching and rebasing from the checkout branch instead of main branch. Thanks for the tips Paula!

- I reviewed and merged the following PRs for David Swan and Adrian
   - [puppet-modulebuilder](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-modulebuilder/pull/39)
   - [puppet-strings](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-strings/pull/271)
   - [community_management](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/70)
   - [puppetlabs/iac](https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/213)
   - [puppetlabs/iac](https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/217)

I continued to work on the Confluence page - 'Accessing IAC Training Materials' for the rest of the week!

Enjoy your Easter holidays :)

See you all next week!
