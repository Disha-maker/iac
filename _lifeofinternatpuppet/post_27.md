Hi everyone,

- I was back to work on Monday 15th March, and released lots of modules using the new release process learnt before going on PTO. I also learnt that JIRA tickets will no longer be raised with the new release process

**Release Prep PRs**
    [puppetlabs-accounts](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-accounts/pull/371) (v7.0.1)
    [puppetlabs-apt](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-apt/pull/977) (v8.0.1)
    [puppetlabs-reboot](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-reboot/pull/285) (v4.0.1)

**Module Releases**
    [puppetlabs-accounts](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/accounts) (v7.0.1)
    [puppetlabs-apt](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/apt) (v8.0.1)
    [puppetlabs-reboot](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/reboot) (v4.0.1)

I really enjoyed releasing these modules :)

- I was also told by Paula during the 1:1 session that start putting the content of the Google Doc - 'Accessing IAC Training Materials' on Confluence. I also learnt that all training materials are drafted and reviewed on Confluence. Thanks for pointing out Paula :)

- The first draft of Accessing IAC Training Materials on Confluence was ready by the end of the week!

- I also spent time catching up on my blog posts for the 'Life of an Intern at Puppet' blog page for Weeks 17 and 18. The [week 17 PR](https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/205) was merged by Paula, thank you!

That's all for this week!

Have a nice weekend!
