Hi everyone,

This week was very busy with my new project 'Revamp the IAC Confluence Wiki'

I learnt how to create design ideas in Confluence. These included uploading and adding images; both with and without links, trying out different column layout to make the page look detailed as well as how to add filters to tables etc. 

Futhermore, I also created some JIRA tickets. During this process I learnt how to write detailed descriptions, add tickets to the overall epic and how to create sub-task tickets for parent tickets. I also discovered that in JIRA a sub-task ticket cannot be within another sub task. 

I also shared a Google Document with my manager and mentor Paula. Thank you for all the useful feedback Norman and Paula. 

I also contacted the Belfast UX team and plan to arrange a meeting hopefully next week to share my design ideas with them and get some useful feedback.

That's everything for this week!

Have a lovely weekend everyone :)
