Hello everyone,

The key highlights from this week included...

- Module releases using the new automated release process via Github Actions:- [puppetlabs-stdlib](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/stdlib) (v7.0.1) and [puppetlabs-ibm_installation_manager](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/ibm_installation_manager) (v3.0.1)

- As a one off, I reviewed and merged a PR for Paula on [puppet-litmus](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/402)

- I continued to work on the IAC New Start Guide - 'Accessing IAC Training Materials'

- I attended the puppet camp for the first time! The sessions attended were on 'Puppet code testing - Modules vs Control Repo', 'Operational Verification' and 'Puppet VS Code - Tips & Tricks!'
Thanks to Martin Alfke, David Schmitt and James Porgan for the great talks!

- I would also like to say thanks to Ben Ford for reaching out and sharing my 'Life of an Intern Blog Page' with the Puppet Community on slack :)

That's everything for this week!

Have a great weekend everyone!
