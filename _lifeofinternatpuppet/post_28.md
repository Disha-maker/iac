Hello everyone,

- Puppet had a company holiday on Monday 22nd March.

- I was on PTO until Thursday 25th March, thanks Norman for approving the holidays.

- I returned on Friday 26th March and continued to work on my pending blog posts for the 'Life of an Intern at Puppet' blog page.

That's all for this week!

Have a lovely weekend!
