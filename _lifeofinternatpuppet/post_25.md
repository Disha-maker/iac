Hi everyone,

- I spent some time with Danny on learning the new release process for a module (puppetlabs-registry) from a automated release prep bot. I learnt the manual way of uploading it on the forge during the demo!

- I merged the [release prep PR](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/pull/1170) for the puppetlabs-stdlib module

- I merged this [PR](https://github.com/puppetlabs/ruby-pwsh/pull/115) for Michael

- I spent some time working on if-else statements tutorials and raised PRs in the IAC Intern Repo
   - [PR_1](https://github.com/puppetlabs/IAC_Intern_Repo/pull/7)
   - [PR_2](https://github.com/puppetlabs/IAC_Intern_Repo/pull/8)

- There were few issues when working on Community Reporting Ticket - 1196 due to force pushing the changes to puppetlabs namespace. Thanks for fixing the issue David Schmitt :)

- I also spent some time setting up the structure for the [IAC Intern Repo](https://github.com/puppetlabs/IAC_Intern_Repo)

- The community reporting tickets were finished by the end of week. The links are given below!
   - [PR_1](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/54)
   - [PR_2](https://github.com/puppetlabs/community_management/pull/62)
   - [JIRA_TICKET_1](https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1196)
   - [JIRA_TICKET_2]((https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/IAC-1197)

That's all for this week!

Have a good weekend!
