Hello all,

- I started the week by restructing the training videos on the shared Google Drive and created a Google Doc on Accessing IAC Training Materials for review from manager and mentor Paula.

- I reviewed PRs for Ciaran on puppet_litmus and pdk-templates
   - [puppet_litmus](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/pull/395)
   - [pdk-templates](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pdk-templates/pull/372)

- During the weekly 1:1 with Paula, I learnt about the best way of doing rebasing and how it works. I was also introduced by new commands; git stash apply and grep.

- I continued to work on restructing the training material and putting together a Google doc.

- I was on PTO on Thursday 11th and Friday 12th March 2021 :)

That's all for this week!
