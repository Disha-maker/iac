Hi all,

The key highlights from this week included:-

- The orderingÂ of the blog posts hyperlinks was fixed on the 'life of an intern blog' [homepage](https://puppetlabs.github.io/iac/docs/life_of_intern.html). Check the link to the PR [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/iac/pull/165)

- Thanks to Paula for a quick session on reviewing and merging PRs. Also a special mention to Sheena for going over the release prep process for the vcsrepo module release using the old method.

- I also learnt how to upload new version of the module on the Forge manually. Thanks to Daiana for the session!

- Futhermore, I also learnt how to change the base branch from main to release on github.

- The confluence page was updated for the 1st part 'release prep process' for a module.

- I received feedback from my manager on my first community ticket - Exclude drafts from module report.
I paired up with Daiana and discussed the feedback received.

Have a nice weekend everyone!
